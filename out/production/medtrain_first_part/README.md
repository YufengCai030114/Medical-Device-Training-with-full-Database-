# Medical-Device-Training
The Medical Device Training project aims to develop a digital tool that enhances traceability in the training and certification process of medical devices. The system connects risks, required skills, training materials, assessments, and trainee performance, ensuring that all identified risks are properly addressed through training and evaluation.
